  % TODO Add Yli-Jyra:2011
  In recent years, the problem of finite state Constraint Grammar~(CG) parsing has
  received renewed attention. Both \shortcite{Hulden:2011} and
  \shortcite{Peltonen:2011} presented compilers that convert CG rules to finite
  state transducers. While these formalisms serve their purpose as proofs of the
  concept, their performance lags behind other implementations.  %TODO implementionS?
  % TODO I am not talking about compilation, but application
  
  In this paper, we argue that fault lies with using generic finite state
  libraries, and not with the formalisms themselves. We present an open-source
  implementation that capitalizes on the characteristics of CG rule
  application to improve execution time. The implementation achieves performance
  comparable to the current open-source state of the art.
  % TODO OMG this is horrible

\subsection{Methodology}
% TDOO fomacg_proc vs fomacg-proc
The performance of \texttt{fomacg\_proc} has been measured against that of
\texttt{cg-proc}, VISL-GC's rule applier. The programs were run on three
Apertium CG grammars: the toy Hungarian grammar used for development, the Breton
grammar from the \texttt{br-fr} language pair and the version of the Finnish
grammar due to Karlsson in the \texttt{sme-fin} pair. % TODO: what is sme? Citations!
% TODO: the corpora we run the grammars on
The tests were conducted on a consumer-grade laptop with a 2.2GHz Core2Duo CPU
and 4GB RAM, running Linux.

Since VISL-GC uses CG-3, and fomacg only supports CG-2, a one-to-one comparison
with the grammars above was infeasible. Therefore, we extracted the subset of
rules from each that compiled under fomacg, and carried out the tests on these
subsets. Table~\ref{tab:grammar_size} shows the number of rules in the original
and the CG-2 grammars.

In the following, we are mainly concerned with the time required for rule
application. However, while we could separate the initialization and execution
times for \texttt{fomacg\_proc}, we could not do the same for \texttt{cg-proc},
and therefore we decided to compare the rule application time of
\texttt{fomacg\_proc} with the full running time of \texttt{cg-proc}.
While this may seem unfair, initialization is a one-time cost and gets
proportionally smaller as the input grows; furthermore, the size of the VISL-GC
grammar binaries is so small that the loading time is negligible.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Outline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation matters.
\item We've made some real advances on the state-of-the-art free/open-source
  FST implementations of CG. 
\item Here we need to describe how we are going to reduce the size problem.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Read and add Yli-Jyra:2011 -- a different method (I also was thinking
%       about a two-step method, where the first level converts cohorts to 
%       some representation (the sets it contains, etc.), and the second level
%       does something else).
